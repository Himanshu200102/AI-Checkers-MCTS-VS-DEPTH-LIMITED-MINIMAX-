# Checkers Game AI

This project implements an AI-driven checkers game, allowing you to compare the performance of Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms.

## Introduction

The project contains Python code for playing checkers using two different AI algorithms: Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of decision-making, game outcome, and other metrics.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need Python 3.x installed on your system along with the following dependencies:

- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
